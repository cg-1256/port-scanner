## What is This Project
This is a basic port scanning project that I am hoping to expand upon to give it more functionality.

## Running the code
### Running the Shell Script

> chmod +x run.sh;
>
> ./run.sh


### Set up the Code Yourself

> pip3 install -r requirements.txt;
>
> chmod +x app.py;
> 
> python3 ./app.py;
