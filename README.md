## What is This Project
This is a repository containing my projects in response to the [git@github.com:cg-1256/skill-level-upper.git](https://github.com/EONRaider/100-redteam-projects) repository. Each individual project is contained in a sub-directory, with a corresponding number it its name. 

The aim of the project is to expand my own skills in all areas of programming and knowledge of cyber security.
